Compared with original proposal, we are on track for all our functionality modules, while only changing the power source from battery to power bank, to better keep the whole system in the chassis and feed them with 5V voltage.

### Codes

Completed - DCmotor.c  servoMotor.c
In progress - adps.c  main.c
Reference - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960/blob/main/adafruit_apds9960/apds9960.py  This is adps's sample code in python.

### Media
#### Materials

#### Troubleshooting
ADPS motion detection is unstable, it almost can only detect the presence of our hands but not the motion/direction. We used distance detection to test the feasibility of our overall system logic, but wait to be decided whether to optimize motion algorithm, or change sensor, or change to picoML to do other fancy sensing.

ADPS minicom output:
